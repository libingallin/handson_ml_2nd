    "The shape of the weight matrix depends on the number of inputs. This is why it is recommended to specify the `input_shape` when creating the first layer in a Sequential model. However, if you **do not specify the input shape, it’s OK**: Keras will **simply wait until it knows the input shape before it actually builds the model**. This will happen either when you **feed it actual data (e.g., during training)**, or when you **call its `build()` method**. **Until the model is really built, the layers will not have any weights, and you will not be able to do certain things (such as print the model summary or save the model)**. So, if you know the input shape when creating the model, it is best to specify it."
